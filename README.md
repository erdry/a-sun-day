## 🌄 Overview

**A Sun Day** is a generative art sketch that visualizes the calm rhythm of nature — a slow sunrise and sunset over mountainous terrain, accompanied by ambient tones and shifting poetry. Built with **p5.js**, this piece is part of my creative coding portfolio to explore how code can create emotion.

The project combines:
- Animated day–night cycles
- Randomized generative mountains
- Poetic lines that follow the time of day
- Ambient sound generated algorithmically
- UI sliders to control pace and terrain
- Elegant minimal UI with subtle textures
